"""
Write a program to implement K-means clustering using Euclidean distance, and to
evaluate the resulting clustering using sum-squared error, sum-squared separation, and entropy.
"""

"""
Experiment 1: Repeat the following 5 times, with different random number seeds.
Run your clustering program on the training data (optdigits.train) with K = 10,
obtaining 10 final cluster centers. (Remember not to use the class attribute in the clustering!)
Your initial cluster centers should be chosen at random, with each attribute Ai being an integer in the range [0,16].
Stop iterating K-Means when all cluster centers stop changing or if the algorithm is stuck in an oscillation.

Choose the run (out of 5) that yields the smallest sum-squared error (SSE).
• For this best run, in your report give the sum-squared error, sum-squared separation,
and mean entropy of the resulting clustering. (See the class slides for definitions.)
• Now use this clustering to classify the test data, as follows:
– Associate each cluster center with the most frequent class it contains.
If there is a tie for most frequent class, break the tie at random.
– Assign each test instance the class of the closest cluster center. Again, ties are broken at random.
Give the accuracy on the test data as well a confusion matrix.
– Note: It’s possible that a particular class won’t be the most common one
for any cluster, and therefore no test digit will ever get that label.
• Calculate the accuracy on the test data and create a confusion matrix for the results on the test data.
• Visualize the resulting cluster centers. That is, for each of the 10 cluster centers,
use the cluster center’s attributes to draw the corresponding digit on an 8 x 8 grid.
You can do this using any matrix-to-bit-map format – e.g., pgm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format#PGM_example
